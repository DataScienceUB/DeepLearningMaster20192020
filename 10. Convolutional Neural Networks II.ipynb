    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "+ **ZF Net**. The ILSVRC 2013 winner was a Convolutional Network from Matthew Zeiler and Rob Fergus. It became known as the ZFNet (short for Zeiler & Fergus Net). It was an improvement on AlexNet by tweaking the architecture hyperparameters, in particular by expanding the size of the middle convolutional layers and making the stride and filter size on the first layer smaller.\n",

    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "+ **VGGNet**. The runner-up in ILSVRC 2014 was the network from Karen Simonyan and Andrew Zisserman that became known as the VGGNet. Its main contribution was in showing that the depth of the network is a critical component for good performance. Their final best network contains 16 CONV/FC layers and, appealingly, features an **extremely homogeneous architecture that only performs 3x3 convolutions and 2x2 pooling from the beginning to the end**. A downside of the VGGNet is that it is more expensive to evaluate and uses a lot more memory and parameters. Most of these parameters are in the first fully connected layer, and it was since found that these FC layers can be removed with no performance downgrade, significantly reducing the number of necessary parameters.\n",

    "It turns out that this conversion allows us to “slide” the original ConvNet very efficiently across many spatial positions in a larger image, in a single forward pass.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if $224x224$ image gives a volume of size $[7x7x512]$ - i.e. a reduction by 32, then forwarding an image of size 384x384 through the converted architecture would give the equivalent volume in size $[12x12x512]$, since $384/32 = 12$. Following through with the next 3 CONV layers that we just converted from FC layers would now give the final volume of size $[6x6x1000]$, since $(12 - 7)/1 + 1 = 6$. Note that instead of a single vector of class scores of size $[1x1x1000]$, we’re now getting and entire $6x6$ array of class scores across the $384x384$ image.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Evaluating the original ConvNet (with FC layers) independently across $224x224$ crops of the $384x384$ image in strides of 32 pixels gives an identical result to forwarding the converted ConvNet one time. Forwarding the converted ConvNet a single time is much more efficient than iterating the original ConvNet over all those 36 locations, since the 36 evaluations share computation. \n",

    "In classification, there’s generally an image with a single object as the focus and the task is to say what that image is. But when we look at the world around us, we see complicated sights with multiple overlapping objects, and different backgrounds and we not only classify these different objects but also identify their boundaries, differences, and relations to one another!\n",
    "\n",
    "To what extent do CNN generalize to object detection? Object detection is the task of finding the different objects in an image and classifying them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### R-CNN\n",
    "\n",
    "A team, comprised of Ross Girshick (a name we’ll see again), Jeff Donahue, and Trevor Darrel found that this problem can be solved with AlexNet by testing on the PASCAL VOC Challenge, a popular object detection challenge akin to ImageNet.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of R-CNN is to take in an image, and correctly identify where the main objects (via a bounding box) in the image.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Inputs: Image\n",
    "\n",
    ">Outputs: Bounding boxes + labels for each object in the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "But how do we find out where these bounding boxes are? R-CNN proposes a bunch of boxes in the image and see if any of them actually correspond to an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "R-CNN creates these bounding boxes, or region proposals, using a process called Selective Search (see http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs7670/2014sp/slides/VisionSeminar14.pdf). \n",
    "\n",
    "At a high level, Selective Search (shown in the image above) looks at the image through windows of different sizes, and for each size tries to group together adjacent pixels by texture, color, or intensity to identify objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the proposals are created, R-CNN warps the region to a standard square size and passes it through to a modified version of AlexNet.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the final layer of the CNN, R-CNN adds a Support Vector Machine (SVM) that simply classifies whether this is an object, and if so what object. \n",

    "<img src=\"images/rcnn.png\" alt=\"\" style=\"width: 800px;\"/> \n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, having found the object in the box, can we tighten the box to fit the true dimensions of the object? We can, and this is the final step of R-CNN. R-CNN runs a simple linear regression on the region proposal to generate tighter bounding box coordinates to get our final result. Here are the inputs and outputs of this regression model:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Inputs: sub-regions of the image corresponding to objects.\n",

    "### Fast R-CNN\n",
    "\n",
    "R-CNN works really well, but is really quite slow for a few simple reasons:\n",
    "+ It requires a forward pass of the CNN (AlexNet) for every single region proposal for every single image (that’s around 2000 forward passes per image!).\n",
    "+ It has to train three different models separately - the CNN to generate image features, the classifier that predicts the class, and the regression model to tighten the bounding boxes. This makes the pipeline extremely hard to train.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2015, Ross Girshick, the first author of R-CNN, solved both these problems, leading to Fast R-CNN. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the forward pass of the CNN, Girshick realized that for each image, a lot of proposed regions for the image invariably overlapped causing us to run the same CNN computation again and again (~2000 times!). His insight was simple — Why not run the CNN just once per image and then find a way to share that computation across the ~2000 proposals?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is exactly what Fast R-CNN does using a technique known as **RoIPool** (Region of Interest Pooling). At its core, RoIPool shares the forward pass of a CNN for an image across its subregions. In the image below, notice how the CNN features for each region are obtained by selecting a corresponding region from the CNN’s feature map. Then, the features in each region are pooled (usually using max pooling). So all it takes us is one pass of the original image as opposed to ~2000!\n",

    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The second insight of Fast R-CNN is to jointly train the CNN, classifier, and bounding box regressor in a single model. Where earlier we had different models to extract image features (CNN), classify (SVM), and tighten bounding boxes (regressor), Fast R-CNN instead used a single network to compute all three.\n",

    "### Faster R-CNN\n",
    "\n",
    "Even with all these advancements, there was still one remaining bottleneck in the Fast R-CNN process — the region proposer. As we saw, the very first step to detecting the locations of objects is generating a bunch of potential bounding boxes or regions of interest to test. In Fast R-CNN, these proposals were created using Selective Search, a fairly slow process that was found to be the bottleneck of the overall process.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the middle 2015, a team at Microsoft Research composed of Shaoqing Ren, Kaiming He, Ross Girshick, and Jian Sun, found a way to make the region proposal step almost cost free through an architecture they (creatively) named Faster R-CNN.\n",
    "\n",
    "The insight of Faster R-CNN was that region proposals depended on features of the image that were already calculated with the forward pass of the CNN (first step of classification). So why not reuse those same CNN results for region proposals instead of running a separate selective search algorithm?\n",

    "### Mask R-CNN\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we’ve seen how we’ve been able to use CNN features in many interesting ways to effectively locate different objects in an image with bounding boxes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Can we extend such techniques to go one step further and locate exact pixels of each object instead of just bounding boxes? This problem, known as image segmentation, is what Kaiming He and a team of researchers, including Girshick, explored at Facebook AI using an architecture known as Mask R-CNN.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that Faster R-CNN works so well for object detection, could we extend it to also carry out pixel level segmentation? \n",
    "\n",
    "Mask R-CNN does this by adding a branch to Faster R-CNN that outputs a binary mask that says whether or not a given pixel is part of an object. The branch (in white in the above image), as before, is just a Fully Convolutional Network on top of a CNN based feature map. Here are its inputs and outputs:\n",
