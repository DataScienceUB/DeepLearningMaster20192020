Specifically, it is trained to turn the target sequences into the same sequences but offset by one timestep in the future, a training process called **teacher forcing** in this context. Importantly, the encoder uses as initial state the state vectors from the encoder, which is how the decoder obtains information about what it is supposed to generate. Effectively, the decoder learns to generate ``targets[t+1...]`` given ``targets[...t]``, conditioned on the input sequence."
