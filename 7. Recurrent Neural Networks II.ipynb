This requires a more advanced setup, which is what people commonly refer to when mentioning \"sequence to sequence models\" with no further context. Here's how it works:\n",

Note that we discard the outputs of the encoder RNN, only recovering the state. This state will serve as the \"context\", or \"conditioning\", of the decoder in the next step.\n",
        "+ Another RNN layer (or stack thereof) acts as \"decoder\": it is trained to predict the next characters of the target sequence, given previous characters of the target sequence. Specifically, it is trained to turn the target sequences into the same sequences but offset by one timestep in the future, a training process called \"teacher forcing\" in this context. Importantly, the encoder uses as initial state the state vectors from the encoder, which is how the decoder obtains information about what it is supposed to generate. Effectively, the decoder learns to generate ``targets[t+1...]`` given ``targets[...t]``, conditioned on the input sequence."
