    "> The **backpropagation** algorithm was originally introduced in the 1970s, but its importance wasn't fully appreciated until a famous 1986 paper by David Rumelhart, Geoffrey Hinton, and Ronald Williams. (Michael Nielsen in \"Neural Networks and Deep Learning\", http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap2.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Backpropagation** is the key algorithm that makes training deep models computationally tractable. For modern neural networks, it can make training with gradient descent as much as ten million times faster, relative to a naive implementation. That’s the difference between a model taking a week to train and taking 200,000 years. (Christopher Olah, 2016)\n",

    "## Deep Learning tricks\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> A naïve description of the basic setup in deep learning would be: *a many-layers-deep network of linear layers, linear convolutions and occasionally recurrent structures with nonlinear activation functions that is trained by computing the gradient of the training error through reverse mode AD.*.\n",
    "\n",
    "AD is a critical component when developing deep models because the use of SGD is much more easy and robust (f.e. derivative computation is free of bugs!), but in spite of this fact optimization of deep models is not yet an easy task. Gradient-based optimization still suffers from some problems:\n",
    "+ The system can be poorly conditioned (changing one parameter requires precise compensatory changes to other parameters to avoid large increases in the optimization criterion). \n",
    "+ Simply calculating the actual gradient is so slow in deep learning systems that it is impractical to use the true\n",
    "gradient for purposes of optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to address each issues, deep learning community has developed some **tricks**. First, gradient tricks, namely methods to make the gradient either easier to calculate or to give it more desirable properties. And second, optimization tricks, namely new methods related to stochastic optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "The deep learning community has been developing many methods to make gradient descent work with deep architectures. These methods (related to model architectures and gradient calculation) are  numerous. Here we discuss only a small sample of methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ It is not really feasible to calculate the true gradient when there is a large dataset.  Instead a sample is used. Calculating the gradient of the error of just a random sample from the dataset (or sequential windows, assuming the dataset has been randomly shuffled) is much faster.\n",
    "+ In calculating the stochastic gradient, it is tempting to do the minimal amount of computation necessary to obtain an unbiased estimate, which would involve a single sample from the training set. In practice it has proven much better to use a block of contiguous samples, on the order of dozens.  This has two advantages: the first is less noise, and the second is that data-parallelism can be used.\n",
    "+ In a multi-layered structure, one would expect the gradients of quantities at early layers to be nearly zero (assuming the gains at intermediate levels are below unity) or to be enormous (assuming the gains are above unity). The tricks are:\n",
    "    + Rectified linear units instead of sigmoids. Classic multi-layer perceptrons use the sigmoid activation function, but this has a derivative which goes to zero when its input is too strong.  That means that when a unit in the network receives a very strong signal, it becomes difficult to change. Using a rectified linear unit (ReLU) function, overcomes this problem, making the system more plastic even when strong signals are present.\n",
    "    + Gradient clipping. In the domain of deep learning, there are often outliers in the training set: exemplars that are being classified incorrectly, for example, or improper images in a visual classification task, or mislabeled examples, and the like. These can cause a large gradient inside a single mini-batch, which washes out the more appropriate signals. For this reason a technique called gradient clipping is often used, in which components of the gradient exceeding a threshold (in absolute value) are pushed down to that threshold.\n",
    "+ Keeping the error surface well conditioned for gradient optimization has been one of the keys to the current widespread deployment of deep learning.\n",
    "    + Dropout. Imagine a network in which multiple units together represent some important feature, requiring a precise weighting of their values in downstream processing. This would make optimization quite difficult, as it sets up couplings between parameters which must be maintained. A technique to avoid such “unfortunate collusions” is dropout, in which each unit in the network is, on each training pattern pass, randomly “dropped out” with some probability (typically 50%) by holding its value at zero. This encourages detected features to be independently meaningful. (In “production mode” dropout is turned off, and the weights scaled to compensate, to minimize the noise when performance matters.)\n",
    "    + Batch normalization. Batch Normalization is a technique to provide any layer in a neural network with inputs that are zero mean/unit variance. \n",
    "    + Careful initialization. Considering how the variances of activation values and gradients can be maintained between the layers in a network leads to intelligent normalized initialization schemes, which enable substantially faster optimization convergence. \n",
    "+ Early stopping. When fitting a dynamic system to data, as exact a match as possible is desired, so the true optimum is sought. This is not the case in machine learning, where the optimization is of error on a training set, while the primary concern is generally not performance on the training set, but on as-yet-unseen new data. There is often a tradeoff between the two, encountered after optimization has proceeded for a significant amount of time. This is addressed by early stopping, in which an estimate of performance on unseen data is maintained, and optimization is halted early when this estimated generalization performance stops improving, even if performance on the training set is continuing to improve. \n",
