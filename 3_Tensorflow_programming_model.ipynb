        "When starting off with deep learning, one of the first questions to ask is, which framework to learn?\n",
        "\n",
        "Common choices include TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras. All of these choices have their own pros and cons and have their own way of doing things.\n",
        "\n",
        "> From [**The Anatomy of Deep Learning Frameworks**](https://medium.com/@gokul_uf/the-anatomy-of-deep-learning-frameworks-46e2a7af5e47#.3ywhrk1st)\n",
        "\n",
        "> The core components of a deep learning framework we must consider are:\n",
        "\n",
        "> + How Tensor Objects are defined. At the heart of the framework is the tensor object. A tensor is a generalization of a matrix to n-dimensions. We need a Tensor Object that supports storing the data in form of tensors. Not just that, we would like the object to be able to convert other data types (images, text, video) into tensors and back, supporting indexing, overloading operators, having a space efficient way to store the data and so on.\n",
        "+ How Operations on the Tensor Object are defined. A neural network can be considered as a series of Operations performed on an input tensor to give an output. \n",
        "+ The use of a Computation Graph and its Optimizations. Instead of implementing operations as functions, they are usually implemented as **classes**. This allows us to store more information about the operation like calculated shape of the output (useful for sanity checks), how to compute the gradient or the gradient itself (for the auto-differentiation), have ways to be able to decide whether to compute the op on GPU or CPU and so on. The power of neural networks lies in the ability to chain multiple operations to form a powerful approximator. Therefore, the standard use case is that you can initialize a tensor, perform actions after actions on them and finally interpret the resulting tensor as labels or real values. Unfortunately, as you chain more and more operations together, several issues arise that can drastically slow down your code and introduce bugs as well. There are more such issues and it becomes necessary to be able to get a bigger picture to even notice that these issues exist. We need a way to optimize the resultant chain of operations for both space and time. A Computation Graph which is basically an object that contains links to the instances of various Ops and the relations between which operation takes the output of which operation as well as additional information. \n",
        "+ The use of Auto-differentiation tools. Another benefit of having the computational graph is that calculating gradients used in the learning phase becomes modular and straightforward to compute. \n",
        "+ The use of BLAS/cuBLAS and cuDNN extensions for maximizing performance. BLAS or Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms are a collection of optimized matrix operations, initially written in Fortran. These can be leveraged to do very fast matrix (tensor) operations and can provide significant speedups. There are many other software packages like Intel MKL, ATLAS which also perform similar functions. BLAS packages are usually optimized assuming that the instructions will be run on a CPU. In the deep learning situation, this is not the case and BLAS may not be able to fully exploit the parallelism offered by GPGPUs. To solve this issue, NVIDIA has released cuBLAS which is optimized for GPUs. This is now included with the CUDA toolkit."
